Problem Description
You are given a nested object obj and number num as arguments. You have to implement the function modifyNestedObject which will modify the streetNumber property to num in the nested object address and return the modified object.


Hint 1: Nested objects are the objects that are inside another object.

Hint 2: To access nested objects we use dot or bracket notation for example if there is an object named A inside this we have another object B with property x to access x we write A.B.x


Sample Input
{ address: { streetNumber: 5 } }, 8


Sample Output
{ address: { streetNumber: 8 } }


Explanation
We have modified the streetNumber from 5 to 8.

/////

function modifyNestedObject(obj, num) {
  // You only need to implement this function.
  obj['address']['streetNumber'] = num;
  return obj;
  
}
