Problem Description
You are given two numbers num and den. When we divide num with den, if both are equal to 0 it gives NaN. We need to handle this case and return 0. You have to implement the function divide such that it should divide num with den and return the result.


Hint: Remember to handle the case when both num and den are 0.


Sample Input
3, 6


Sample Output
0.5


Explanation
3 divided by 6 is 0.5


/////



function divide(num, den) {
    // You only need to implement this function.
    var result = num/den;
    if (num == 0 && den == 0){
        return 0;
    }
    return result;
}
