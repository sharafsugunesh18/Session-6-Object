You are given an array of strings str as an argument. You have to implement the function mergedString which returns the merged string formed by only the first three elements of the array. We have to use the destructuring syntax to extract the first three array values.

Please note: The length of the array will always be greater than or equal to three.


Hint: The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays into distinct variables.


Sample Input
["code", “for”, “good”, “vibes”, “only”]


Sample Output
code for good


Explanation
The output string contains the first three elements of the array along with space to separate them.

//////

function mergedString(str){
  // You only need to implement this function.
  const[a,b,c] = str;
  return `${a} ${b} ${c}`
}
