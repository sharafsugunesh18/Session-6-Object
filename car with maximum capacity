Problem Description
You are given an array of objects arr. The object is a car that has three properties namely color, type, and capacity. You need to implement the function maxCapacityType which will return the type of car with maximum capacity.


Note: If multiple cars have the same capacity, return the type of the first object that matched.


Hint 1: Use dot notation to access the properties of the object.

Hint 2: Use the length method to find the length of the array.


Sample Input

[

  {

      color: 'red',

      type: 'Station Wagon',

      capacity: 5

  },

  {

      color: 'green',

      type: 'Convertible',

      capacity: 2

  },

  {

      color: 'white',

      type: 'MiniVan',

      capacity: 4

  }

];


Sample Output
Station Wagon


//////


 // You only need to implement this function.
    let maxCapacity = 0;
  let maxCapacityType = '';

  // Iterate through the array of car objects
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // Check if the current car's capacity is greater than the current maximum capacity
    if (arr[i].capacity > maxCapacity) {
      // Update maximum capacity and corresponding car type
      maxCapacity = arr[i].capacity;
      maxCapacityType = arr[i].type;
    }
  }
  // Return the type of car with maximum capacity
  return maxCapacityType;
